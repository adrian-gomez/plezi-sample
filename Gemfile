####################
# gems for databases and models

## if you want to use a database, here are a few common enough options:
# gem 'mysql2'
# gem 'sqlite3'
# gem 'pg'

## MongoDB is a very well known NoSQL DB
## https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver
#
# gem 'mongo'
#
## for a performance boost, the C extentions can be used (NOT JRuby - bson_ext isn't used with JRuby).
#
# gem 'bson_ext'
#
## you can also have a look at the Mongo Mapper ORM
## http://mongomapper.com
#
# gem 'mongo_mapper'

## Sequel:
## http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/README_rdoc.html
## http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/cheat_sheet_rdoc.html
## this seems greate, but we left out any auto-config for this one... seems to work out of the box.
#
# gem 'sequel'

## if you want to use ActiveRecord, uncomment the following line(s)...
## but first, please remember that AcriveRecord needs extra attention when multi-threading
# gem 'activerecord', :require => 'active_record'
# gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
# gem 'standalone_migrations' # will more rake tasks support for ActiveRecord

## active support can run without rails and extends the Ruby language.
## it could be heavy, be warned.
## see: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html
#
# gem 'activesupport', :require => ['active_support', 'active_support/core_ext'] 
## or:
# gem 'activesupport', :require => ['active_support', 'active_support/all']
